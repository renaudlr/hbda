# Hypervolume Box Decomposition Algorithm

This is the source code for two algorithms to compute the _hypervolume indicator_, a widely used measure to compare approximations of the nondominated set in multiobjective optimization.

## Compiling

You will need `cmake` and a C compiler to build the project.

Then run from the root directory of the project:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This will build the project in the `build` subdirectory.
